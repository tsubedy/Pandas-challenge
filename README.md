Data was analyzed in various aspects including total school expenditures, per capita expenses, performances of schools based on math scores and reading scores and their passing rates by schools types, grade levels, and size of schools on the basis of the number of students.

While looking at the overall passing rate for the entire schools in the city, it was found that 65.2% of the total students were passed with higher reading score compared to math scores. The charter schools were found to be better performing (more than 90% overall passing rate) compared to district ones (54%). 

Average maths and reading scores were found consistent across different grade levels by schools. Math passing rates were consistently lower across every metric, but the difference 
between math and reading passing rates is higher amoung lower performing schools.
